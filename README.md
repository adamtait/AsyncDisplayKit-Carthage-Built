# Carthage-built (specifically, AsyncDisplayKit)

This repo contains Carthage-built artifacts. 

Specifically, the built artifacts are from the [TextureGroup/Texture](https://github.com/TextureGroup/Texture) ( _AsyncDisplayKit_ ) project. Storing these built artifacts was necessary because it seems that Carthage is no longer able to build the artifacts from scratch.
